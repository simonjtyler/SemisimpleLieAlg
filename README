Semisimple Lie Algebras
Version: 0.1

An incomplete Mathematica package for doing calculations on semisimple Lie algebras and a notebook full of tests of the various functions.

To aid sensible version control, history tracking and caching have been disabled in the SemisimpleLieAlg.tests.nb notebook. Also, all output is deleted and cells minimized before commits.
